We show that the learning of a state-action return distribution function can be used to improve the Q-value estimation accuracy. We employ the return distribution function within the maximum entropy RL framework in order to develop what we call the Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) algorithm, which is an off-policy method for continuous control setting. Unlike traditional distributional RL algorithms which typically only learn a discrete return distribution, DSAC directly learns a continuous return distribution by truncating the difference between the target and current distribution to prevent gradient explosion. Additionally, we propose a new Parallel Asynchronous Buffer-Actor-Learner architecture (PABAL) to improve the learning efficiency, which is a generalization of current high-throughput learning architectures. We evaluate our method on the suite of MuJoCo continuous control tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.","tags":[],"title":"Distributional Soft Actor-Critic: Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for Addressing Value Estimation Errors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yang Guan","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Centralized coordination methods globally coordinate vehicles approaching the intersection from all sections by considering their states altogether. However, they need substantial computation resources since they own a centralized controller to optimize the trajectories for all approaching vehicles in real-time. In this paper, we propose a centralized coordination scheme of automated vehicles at an intersection without traffic signals using reinforcement learning (RL) to address low computation efficiency suffered by current centralized coordination methods. We first propose an RL training algorithm, model accelerated proximal policy optimization (MA-PPO), which incorporates a prior model into proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to accelerate the learning process in terms of sample efficiency. Then we present the design of state, action and reward to formulate centralized coordination as an RL problem. Finally, we train a coordinate policy in a simulation setting and compare computing time and traffic efficiency with a coordination scheme based on model predictive control (MPC) method. Results show that our method spends only 1/400 of the computing time of MPC and increase the efficiency of the intersection by 4.5 times.","tags":[],"title":"Centralized Cooperation for Connected and Automated Vehicles at Intersections by Proximal Policy Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yangang Ren","Jingliang Duan","Shengbo Eben Li","Yang Guan","Qi Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"333d33df1352da1dd71d42baa5c197ed","permalink":"/publication/minmax_dsac/","publishdate":"2021-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/minmax_dsac/","section":"publication","summary":"Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable performance in numerous sequential decision making and control tasks. However, a common problem is that learned nearly optimal policy always overfits to the training environment and may not be extended to situations never encountered during training. For practical applications, the randomness of environment usually leads to some devastating events, which should be the focus of safety-critical systems such as autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce the minimax formulation and distributional framework to improve the generalization ability of RL algorithms and develop the Minimax Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (Minimax DSAC) algorithm. Minimax formulation aims to seek optimal policy considering the most severe variations from environment, in which the protagonist policy maximizes action-value function while the adversary policy tries to minimize it. Distributional framework aims to learn a state-action return distribution, from which we can model the risk of different returns explicitly, thereby formulating a risk-averse protagonist policy and a risk-seeking adversarial policy. We implement our method on the decision-making tasks of autonomous vehicles at intersections and test the trained policy in distinct environments. Results demonstrate that our method can greatly improve the generalization ability of the protagonist agent to different environmental variations.","tags":[],"title":"Improving Generalization of Reinforcement Learning with Minimax Distributional Soft Actor-Critic","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
